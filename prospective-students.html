    <h1>üîç Call for Motivated Students</h1>
    <p>
      I work in the areas of network security, privacy, systems, and measurements, with a strong emphasis on taking real-world and applied problems.

        If you're curious, hands-on, and excited to build reproducible research that blends creativity with technical depth, I‚Äôd love to hear from you.

        For a sense of what working together might look like, I recommend reading <a href="https://www.devashishgosain.com/page3"> this</a> -- I share a similar philosophy around mentorship and conducting high-quality research.

      Attached is a <a href="challenge-pcap.pcap">PCAP file</a> containing a CTF style challenge. It contains a hidden flag somewhere in the traffic. If you can extract the hidden flag from the traffic, include it in your email‚Äîit‚Äôs a great way to stand out and show initiative. But if you can't, don't worry its not a qualifying criteria, but preference will be given to students who solve it.
